# CapsNet-Mxnet

A Mxnet implementation of CapsNet in Hinton's paper [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)


## Requirements
- [Mxnet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) 

## Usage

### Training
**Step 1.**
Install Mxnet:

`$ pip install mxnet`

**Step 2.** 
Clone this repository with ``git``.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AaronLeong/CapsNet_Mxnet.git
$ cd CapsNet_Mxnet
```

**Step 3.** 
Training:
```
$ python CapsNet.py
```

## Results
   
Maybe there're some problems in my implementation. Contributions are welcome.

## TODO:
- Add reconstruction part, which should be easy. 
- Optimize the code implementation and comments

## Other Implementations
- [CapsNet-Keras](https://github.com/naturomics/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras.git): 
Very good implementation. I referred to this repository in my code.
